            <h2>What is Ikigai?</h2>
            <p>Ikigai (生き甲斐) is a Japanese concept that means "a reason for being." It is believed to be the intersection of four fundamental elements: what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for.</p>
            <p>The term is composed of two Japanese words: "iki" (生き), which means "life," and "gai" (甲斐), which means "value" or "worth." Together, these words describe the idea of finding joy in life through purpose.</p>

            <h2>Finding Your Ikigai</h2>
            <p>Discovering your ikigai is a personal journey of self-reflection and exploration. It requires honest assessment of your interests, abilities, values, and the needs of the world around you.</p>
            <p>The Ikigai Pathway app guides you through this process, helping you identify each element of your ikigai and visualize how they intersect. Through thoughtful questions and AI-powered suggestions, we aim to make this journey of self-discovery both insightful and enjoyable.</p>
            <p>Remember that ikigai is not static—it can evolve as you grow and change throughout your life. The goal is not to find a perfect, unchanging purpose, but to live with intention and meaning each day.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Context</h2>
            <p>The concept of ikigai originated in Okinawa, Japan, which is known for having some of the longest-living people in the world. Many attribute their longevity partly to having a clear sense of purpose that motivates them to stay active and engaged with life.</p>
            <p>Unlike Western notions of purpose that often emphasize achievement and success, ikigai embraces the smaller joys of daily life and the satisfaction that comes from making a contribution, however modest it may be.</p>
