            <h2>What is Ikigai?</h2>
            <p>Ikigai (生き甲斐) is a Japanese concept that means "a reason for being." It is the intersection of what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for.</p>
            <p>The term is composed of two Japanese words: "iki" (生き), which means "life," and "gai" (甲斐), which means "value" or "worth." Together, these words describe the source of value in one's life or the things that make one's life worthwhile.</p>

            <h2>Ikigai and Well-being</h2>
            <p>Research has shown that having a sense of purpose—an ikigai—is associated with greater happiness, better health, and even longevity. In Okinawa, Japan, which is known for its high concentration of centenarians, many elderly people attribute their long and fulfilling lives to having a clear ikigai.</p>
            <p>By finding and living your ikigai, you can experience:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Greater satisfaction and fulfillment in your work</li>
                <li>More meaningful connections with others</li>
                <li>A sense of contribution to something larger than yourself</li>
                <li>Increased resilience in the face of challenges</li>
                <li>A clearer sense of direction and purpose</li>
